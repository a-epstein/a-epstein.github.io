	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>
My name is Amanda Epstein, and I am an aspiring data scientist currently working as a laboratory technician. Since discovering data science, I have been learning R, Go, and SQL to make a career change where I can utilize my passion for exploring data and solving problems. There is something incredible about taking raw data, telling a story from it, and making use of that story to gain insight about the world in which we live. 

Check out my Projects page to see what I have been working on!</p>
